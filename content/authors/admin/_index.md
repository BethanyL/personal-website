Dr. Bethany Lusch is an Assistant Computer Scientist in the data science group at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Lab. Her research expertise includes developing methods and tools to integrate AI with science, especially for dynamical systems and PDE-based simulations. Her recent work includes developing machine-learning emulators to replace expensive parts of simulations, such as computational fluid dynamics simulations of engines and climate simulations. She is also working on methods that incorporate domain knowledge in machine learning, representation learning, and using machine learning to analyze supercomputer logs. She holds a PhD and MS in applied mathematics from the University of Washington and a BS in mathematics from the University of Notre Dame.
